# Haskell
By: Jonathan Thomas

First Haskell project.
Project contains 4 functions. Range, sorted, nprime, and bills.

Range tells the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in an array.

Sorted returns true if an array passed in is sorted ascendingly, false otherwise.

nprime returns the nth prime integer, where n is an integer passed in.

Finally, bills recieves an integer input and returns a 4 element tuple telling how many 20, 10, 5, and 1 dollar bills are necessary to equal the passed in dollar amount.
